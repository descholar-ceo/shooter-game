## Project description
This project is an implementation of an HTML5 game that runs in the browser, using Phaser3 technology. Being new to Phaser,  and game development, I built a very easy-to-play game I used to see my friends playing it a few years ago unfortunately I was not interested in games at that time. But this time I enjoyed working on this project and now I can understand how they felt while playing such a game.

This project is my capstone project at the end of the Microverse Javascript curriculum. The project's specifications are listed [here](https://www.notion.so/Shooter-game-203e819041c7486bb36f9e65faecba27).
